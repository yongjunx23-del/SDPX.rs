    SDPX.Reals

The full real line. A scalar variable (or vector block) constrained to
`Reals` is unconstrained. This type intentionally mirrors the
`MathOptInterface.Reals` mathematical set but is SDPX-owned so the
frontend never depends on MOI's type identity.

The closed nonnegative orthant `{x >= 0}`. As a product-cone block it
is one vector block; it is never split into scalar blocks.

The closed nonpositive orthant `{x <= 0}`. As a product-cone block it
is one vector block.

The zero / equality subspace `{x == 0}`. As a product-cone block it is

The second-order cone of *vector dimension* `n`:

belongs to the block shape (`SDPX.NativeBlock`), not to this type.

dimension `n` belongs to the block shape.

The 3-dimensional exponential cone

closed limit face `{ (x, 0, z) : x <= 0, z >= 0 }` (that is, the union
of these two sets). The dimension is fixed at 3 and
is validated at block construction: an exponential block always has
vector shape `n == 3`, never more and never less. This type carries no
data and remains one block — it is never split or lifted.

The dimension is fixed at 3. `alpha` is retained in its source arithmetic
type and is converted only when the model is canonicalized into the solver's
working arithmetic.
