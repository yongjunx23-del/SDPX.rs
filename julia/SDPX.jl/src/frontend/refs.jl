    SDPX.VariableRef

Stable internal reference to a variable owned by a `SDPX.Model`.

Fields
- `model::UInt64`: opaque monotone identity of the owning model (never
  exposed as a pointer and never reused after garbage collection).
- `block::Int`: 1-based product-cone block number. PSD blocks count as
  ONE block; `block` alone addresses the whole `n × n` block.
- `index::Int`: 1-based index of the variable within `block`. For a PSD
  block this is the 1-based position in the lower-triangle packed
  vector (`PSDPackedStorage` layout), i.e. one of
  `1:n(n+1)/2`.

The pair `(block, index)` is 1-based; zero or negative values are
rejected by `Model` construction paths, never by the ref itself.

"""
    SDPX.ConstraintRef

Stable internal reference to a constraint owned by a `SDPX.Model`.

Fields
- `model::UInt64`: opaque identity of the owning model (same
  convention as `VariableRef`).
- `block::Int`: 1-based affine-cone block number (each affine row
  block corresponds to one ordered affine-cone block).
- `index::Int`: 1-based index of the constraint within `block` (row
  number for vector blocks, 1 for scalar blocks).
